=head1 NAME

App::Timestamper::Format - prefix lines with formatted timestamps of their arrivals.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use App::Timestamper::Format;

    App::Timestamper::Format->new({ argv => [@ARGV] })->run();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

App::Timestamper is a pure-Perl command line program that filters the input
so the formatted timestamps based on the C<TIMESTAMPER_FORMAT> env var are
prefixed to the lines based on the time of the arrival.

So if the input was something like:

    First Line
    Second Line
    Third Line

It will become something like:

    11:12:00\tFirst Line
    11:12:02\tSecond Line
    11:12:04\tThird Line

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 “ts” from “moreutils”

“ts” is a program that is reportedely similar to “timestamper” and
is contained in joeyh’s “moreutils” (see L<http://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/>)
package. It is not easy to find online.

=head2 Chumbawamba’s song “Tubthumping”

I really like the song “Tubthumping” by Chumbawamba, which was a hit during
the 1990s and whose title sounds similar to “Timestamping”, so please check it
out:
