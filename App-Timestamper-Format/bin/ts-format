=head1 NAME

ts-format - prefix lines with formatted timestamps of their arrivals.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ long-running-process | tee log | ts-format

=head1 DESCRIPTION

App::Timestamper::Format is a pure-Perl command line program that filters the input
so the formatted timestamps based on the C<TIMESTAMPER_FORMAT> environment variable are
prefixed to the lines based on the time of the arrival.

So if the input was something like:

    First Line
    Second Line
    Third Line

It will become something like:

    11:12:00\tFirst Line
    11:12:02\tSecond Line
    11:12:04\tThird Line
